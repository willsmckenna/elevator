# Elevator Ride v. 1.0

This command line application allows users to create characters (called users in the app, will be described as characters throughout this text) and have them ride the elevator either individually or in groups. The user can see what floor the elevator is on at any time, and also can get a list of all their characters. The elevator responds to multiple character input through moving to pick up 
all characters going up first, drop them off, and then do the same thing for the down characters. 

## Getting Started

Download zip and run app.py from within the root directory on your terminal with the command: python app.py

After starting up the app, a main menu is presented. Here, the user can either choose to create a 
new character, ride as a single character, or if several characters were already made, ride as multiple characters.
You can access the single character's wait and destination floors through going into their personal character 
menus, where you can ride alone, see the elevator's current floor, or change/edit the pick-up and drop-off point. 
To have multiple characters ride, enter that option from the main menu and then enter the names of the characters-
the elevator will find where they currently are and take them to their destination.

### Prerequisites
